I’m Priya Sharma from Mumbai, and this is my genuine experience booking the **Luxury Platinum Yacht by Goan Boat Tour** for my husband’s birthday in Goa. Being someone who is extremely particular about planning events, I wanted the celebration to feel intimate, premium, and memorable — without the usual hotel-party chaos. A friend recommended Goan Boat Tour, and honestly, this turned out to be one of the best decisions I have made.

I first contacted the team through WhatsApp after browsing their website. The response was quick, polite, and very organised. They explained everything clearly — yacht options, capacity, timings, food arrangements, decoration choices, and even suggested the best sunset slot. The level of professionalism instantly gave me confidence that I'm dealing with a reliable company.

### 🎉 Planning the Celebration

Since it was my husband’s birthday, I wanted something elegant but warm. The team helped me customise the plan beautifully. We selected the **Luxury Platinum Yacht**, which accommodates up to **18 people** — perfect for our small family gathering. I was also pleasantly surprised to know that the yacht had **three spacious A/C bedrooms**, which made elderly family members feel comfortable throughout the trip.

The team also arranged a simple but classy décor with balloons, fairy lights, and a small backdrop for cake cutting. It wasn’t over the top — just exactly how I imagined it.

### 🚤 First Impressions: The Yacht & Crew

On the day of the celebration, we reached the jetty a little early. The Goan Boat Tour staff were already present, guiding us, helping with bags, and ensuring everyone boarded safely. As soon as I stepped onto the yacht, I could feel that it was well-maintained, clean, and luxurious.

The **interiors were modern**, the bedrooms smelled fresh, and the air-conditioning was running perfectly. The **upper deck** was my favourite — breezy, scenic, and ideal for photos. The **sound system** was also great, and we played my husband’s favourite playlist the entire evening.

The crew deserves special appreciation. They were polite, attentive, and yet never intrusive. They helped set up our cake, adjusted the lighting for photos, and always made sure everyone felt safe and comfortable.

### 🌅 The Sailing Experience

We booked the **sunset slot**, and the experience was magical. As the yacht gently moved into the open waters, the view was breathtaking — golden sky, calm sea, and soft music in the background. My husband was genuinely surprised, and seeing him smile made all the planning worth it.

My family enjoyed watching dolphins from the deck, clicking pictures, and simply relaxing. The kids had a blast, and the elderly enjoyed the comfort of the A/C lounge. There was enough space for everyone to sit, walk around, dance, and take pictures without feeling crowded.

### 🎂 Cake Cutting & Dinner

The crew helped us set up the cake-cutting area on the deck. With the Goa sunset behind us, it felt like a scene from a movie. After that, we had dinner onboard (food arranged separately but coordinated through Goan Boat Tour). Everything was served neatly and on time.

I also appreciated that they maintained cleanliness throughout. Plates were taken away quietly, the deck stayed tidy, and the atmosphere remained pleasant.

### ❤️ Why I Recommend Goan Boat Tour

The entire experience was so smooth, stress-free, and delightful that I would 100% recommend Goan Boat Tour to anyone planning a celebration in Goa.

What I loved most:
- Professional communication  
- Friendly and experienced crew  
- Clean and truly luxurious yacht  
- Smooth sailing with no delays  
- Perfect arrangements for special occasions  
- Value for money  

My husband, who rarely expresses excitement, said this was one of his *best birthdays ever*. For me, that was all that mattered.

If you’re planning a celebration — birthday, anniversary, proposal, or even a small get-together — trust me, nothing beats a sunset yacht experience in Goa. And Goan Boat Tour makes it absolutely seamless.

**Thank you, Goan Boat Tour, for helping us create a lifelong memory. 🌅❤️**
