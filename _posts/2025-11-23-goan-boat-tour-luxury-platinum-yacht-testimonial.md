I’m Priya Sharma from Mumbai, and I want to share my genuine experience with **Goan Boat Tour** after booking their **Luxury Platinum Yacht** for my husband’s birthday celebration. I had always imagined doing something elegant and truly memorable for him, and this yacht experience turned out to be exactly what I hoped for — maybe even better.

Planning surprises is stressful for me, but the Goan Boat Tour team made everything simple from the very first message. I contacted them on WhatsApp after seeing their yacht photos online, and their reply was quick, professional, and friendly. They clearly explained the available yacht options, pricing, decoration choices, food arrangements, and even suggested the perfect timing — the sunset slot.

### 🎉 Planning the Surprise Celebration

I wanted the ambience to be romantic yet classy. The team helped me customise everything beautifully. We finalised the **Luxury Platinum Yacht**, which can comfortably accommodate **up to 18 people**, although we were just 12. They assured me that it has **three A/C bedrooms**, which was a big relief since both my parents and in-laws were joining us. Comfort was a priority, and the bedrooms were clean, spacious, and well-maintained.

They also handled the décor — balloons, soft lights, cake table, and a small backdrop. It was subtle, warm, and just perfect for a family celebration.

### 🚤 First Impression of the Yacht

On the day of the celebration, the Goan Boat Tour team greeted us at the jetty with smiles and guided us to the yacht. From the moment I stepped onboard, I knew I had made the right choice.

- The yacht was spotless  
- The **interior lounge was air-conditioned and comfortable**  
- The **bedrooms were hotel-like with clean sheets and cooling**  
- The **upper deck was my absolute favourite** — breezy, open, and perfect for sunset photos  
- The **music system** was loud and clear, ideal for a birthday vibe  

The crew members were extremely polite and supportive. They helped with our bags, arranged our food neatly, assisted the elders, and yet never felt intrusive.

### 🌅 The Sailing Experience – Simply Magical

As the yacht began moving, the cool wind, soft music, and open sea created the perfect atmosphere. The children were excited, the seniors were comfortable, and my husband was absolutely stunned — the surprise worked!

The sunset was breathtaking, painting the entire sky in orange and gold. We clicked so many pictures on the upper deck, and every moment felt cinematic.

A few dolphins even popped up near the yacht, and that was such an unexpected delight for everyone on board.

### 🎂 Cake Cutting & Celebration

With the sunset behind us, the crew helped us set up the cake-cutting moment. They even dimmed the deck lights slightly to make the backdrop glow beautifully.

After that, we enjoyed dinner. Though the food was arranged through an external caterer, Goan Boat Tour coordinated everything perfectly — plates, cutlery, warming the food, and serving.

Not once did we feel uncomfortable, rushed, or disturbed.

### ❤️ Why I Recommend Goan Boat Tour

This entire experience felt smooth, premium, and well-managed. What stood out for me:

- Very polite and professional staff  
- Clean, luxurious and well-maintained yacht  
- Comfortable A/C rooms  
- Perfect decoration and ambience  
- Safe sailing experience  
- Ideal for families, couples, and celebrations  
- Absolute value for money  

My husband said this was one of his **most memorable birthdays ever**, and that meant everything to me. The combination of privacy, comfort, family time, and the beauty of Goa’s backwaters made this celebration unforgettable.

I would strongly recommend **Goan Boat Tour** for anyone looking to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, proposals, or even a relaxed family outing. They truly know how to make special moments feel extraordinary.

**Thank you, Goan Boat Tour, for creating a memory that will stay with us forever. 🌅❤️**
